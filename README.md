# Person FlyWay Thymeleaf Java17

This project creates a REST API and Flyway and Hibernate ORM and H2 for DB

The front-end was a choice of OLDSCHOOL Java Web FrontEnds (Servlets, JSF, JSP, PRIMEFACES, Thymeleaf)
Java SWING for Desktop was not included since this was supposed to be a Web Rest API.

I decided to use Thymeleaf as Template Engine

Actuator and Swagger (Open  API3) is included
